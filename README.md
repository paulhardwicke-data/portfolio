### Related career development theory capabilities
My approach to this project demonstrates the following planned happenstance traits:
* Adaptability: I am addressing the 19th team problem via multi-objective optimisation, which reflects my ability to adapt to changing requirements such as migrating legacy web content to SharePoint CMS.
* Optimism: I have approached the subjective topic of fairness with a belief it can be quantified, and trust that this learning experience will help to bridge the gap between my current skills and a preference for data management work.
* Persistence: I am compiling 14 seasons of data with persistent attention to detail and quality results. This is also evident in my maintaining distinction-level GPAs while working full-time.
