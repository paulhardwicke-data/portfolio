# Paul Hardwicke | ICT professional

## Professional statement
Adaptable, optimistic, and persistent information and communications technology (ICT) professional committed to data and content integrity in enterprise-level digital projects.  
With more than 15 years of ICT experience and a lifelong growth mindset, I am now positioned to leverage academic research to address complex systems development challenges.  
My current Master of ICT capstone dissertation applies contemporary data analysis techniques to optimise AFL match scheduling. It demonstrates my information governance and systems development capabilities through the management of interdependent data sets and quality assurance baselines.  
**Career objective:** Seeking to explore growth opportunities in data management that will leverage my ICT employment, academic research, and industry best practice certifications.
