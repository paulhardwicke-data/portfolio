# Dissertation: AFL Scheduling Optimisation

## Project Overview
This project addresses the fairness challenges of a 19-team fixture model (introduced in 2025). The goal is to ensure every team plays 22 games with 2 byes over a 24-round season.

## Key Research Areas
- **Graph Theory Foundations:** Using mathematical abstraction to solve round-robin constraints.
- **The Traveling Tournament Problem (TTP):** Minimizing travel distance and breaks (consecutive home/away games).
- **Pareto Frontier Analysis:** Balancing conflicting constraints like broadcaster needs vs. player welfare.

## Milestones
- **Data Collection:** Historical analysis of 2012–2025 seasons complete.
- **Model Validation:** Expected completion by **01/11/2026**.
